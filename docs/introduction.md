Hello and welcome to the swarm! üêù

Swarm is a decentralised data storage and distribution technology, ready to power the next generation of censorship resistant, unstoppable serverless apps.

Conceptualised by Ethereum's founders as the storage network to complent the blockchain, it is engineered from the ground up to be a closely integrated storage provider for EVM based smart contracts. 

# Access swarm 

Swarm consists of thousands of computers worldwide that are connected to each other forming a resiliant P2P network. There are three main ways for you to participate in the Swarm network.

- Run Light Node [Swarm Desktop]() on your own computer
- Run a [Full Node](), provide storage to the network and get ready to earn BZZ
- Run a [Gateway Node]()

If you'd like to give Swarm a try, or access the Swarm network from a computer that is not yet running a Bee node, you can try it out using one of the [public gateways]().

# Explore Swarm
