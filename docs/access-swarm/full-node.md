Swarm consists of a network of nodes that combine their resources to store all of the Swarm's data. and forward it from the neighbourhoods it is retained in to the nodes uploading and downloading it. In return for providing these services, full nodes will earn BZZ.

## Creating a Full Node

The first implementation of Swarm node is provided by the [Bee software](). It is easy to run Bee on small and inexpensive computers, such as a [Raspberry Pi 4](/docs/installation/rasp-bee-ry-pi), spare hardware you have lying around, or even a cheap cloud hosted VPS (we recommend small, independent providers and colocations).

## Managing Your node

1. Install, fund and start up your node
2. Install swarm-cli and connect it your Bee node
3. Use swarm-cli to check everything is running as it should be
4. Use swarm-cli to check for and cash out cheques
