At its heart, Swarm is a platform to share data. The easiest way to do this is to use a public gateway, which brings Web3 magic to the traditional internet.

Although the gateway is a quick and easy way to try out swarm, or casually upload small files to share with your friends, files you share using this method are limited in size, will be deleted from the network after some time.

:::Caution
Using a gateway means that you will not benefit from many of the privacy guarantees of Swarm. Find out more about Swarm and privacy [here]().
:::

1. Find a gateway and navigate to it using your web browser. For a list of public gateways, see [here]().

In this case, the link is [https://gateway.ethswarm.org/access/6776adcfaaa13ff3cd8f42b07861fa4beb05a4b4e888cb9054af49d822cad4b7]](https://gateway.ethswarm.org/access/6776adcfaaa13ff3cd8f42b07861fa4beb05a4b4e888cb9054af49d822cad4b7).

4. You may now send this link to your friends, family or colleagues and they will be able to retrieve the file from any Swarm gateway, or from their own personal node. üéâ
