Swarm is a [permissionless publishing network]() designed to host **unstoppable** websites and decentralised applications. 

The network is capable of both hosting and delivering websites to your browser directly from other peers in the network. There is no longer any need for a traditional web server such as Apache or Nginx, or a CDN provider.
